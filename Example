Consider 4 attributes: Availability, Technical support, Trust result and Price. User ratings for 5 CSPs for each of these attributes are obtained. These ratings are then normalized and then BSCU is performed to increase profits for a chosen CSP. The output is the minimum price rating and thus the decrease from the initial price rating.
